In part-01 we create Docker image on ansible server through Jenkins job and pushed it onto DockerHub.

Part-01 : Create an docker image
Login to Jenkins console

Create Jenkins job, Fill the following details,

Source Code Management:
Repository : https://github.com/ValaxyTech/hello-world.git
Branches to build : */master
Build:
Root POM:pom.xml
Goals and options : clean install package
Post Steps
Send files or execute commands over SSH

Name: ansible_server
Source files	: webapp/target/*.war
Remove prefix	: webapp/target
Remote directory	: //opt//docker
Send files or execute commands over SSH

Name: ansible_server
Source files	: Dockerfile
Remote directory	: //opt//docker
Exec Command:
cd /opt/docker
docker build -t valaxy_demo .
docker tag valaxy_demo valaxy/valaxy_demo
docker push valaxy/valaxy_demo
docker rmi valaxy_demo valaxy/valaxy_demo
Login to Docker host and check images and containers. (no images and containers)

login to docker hub and check. shouldn't find images with for valaxy_demo

Execute Jenkins job

check images in Docker hub. Now you could able to see new images pushed to Valaxy Docker_Hub

Troubleshooting:
Docker should be installed on ansible server
Should login to "docker hub" on ansible server
ansadmin user should be part of docker group
In Part-02 we create create_docker_container.yml playbook. this get intiated by jenkins job, run by ansible and exected on dokcer_host

Part-02 : Deploy Containers
Write a yml file to create a container (file name : create_docker_container.yml)

  ---
  - hosts: web-servers
    become: true
    tasks:
     - name: stop previous version docker
       shell: docker stop valaxy_demo
     - name: remove stopped container
       shell: docker rm -f valaxy_demo	  
     - name: remove docker images
       shell: docker image rm -f valaxy/valaxy_demo
       
     - name: create docker image
       shell: docker run -d --name valaxy_demo -p 8090:8080 valaxy/valaxy_demo
Add this script to Jenkins job.

Chose "configure" to modify your jenkins job.
Under post build actions
Send files or execute commands over SSH
Exec Command:
   cd /opt/playbooks
   ansible-playbook create_docker_container.yml
Execute Jenkins job.

You could see a new container on your docker host. can able access it from browser on port 8090

Troubleshooting: Makesure you have opened required ports on AWS Security group for this server.

In Part-03 we try to improvise to store docker images previous versions

Part-03 : Deploy with Version Control Containers
So for we used latest docker image to build a container, but what happens if latest version is not working?
One easiest solution is, maintaining version for each build. This can be achieved by using environment variables.

here we use 2 variables

BUILD_ID - The current build id
JOB_NAME - Name of the project of this build. This is the name you gave your job when you first set it up.

Lets modify jenkins job which was created in Part-01 as below.

Create Jenkins job
